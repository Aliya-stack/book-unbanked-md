# Chapter 9: Building Money Warriors  
### The Ultimate Freedom Course for a 12-Year-Old Muslim Boy

> "The best of you are those who learn knowledge and teach it to others."  
> — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

## Imagine a Young Boy

Twelve years old.  
Curious. Bright-eyed. Brave-hearted.  
Living in a world trying to chain him to a desk, a loan, a paycheck, a mortgage — for life.

But instead of swallowing lies,  
he gets handed a secret course.

A course that teaches him how the world really works —  
and how to escape the matrix before it even catches him.

This is that course.

## Course Objective

To transform a 12-year-old Muslim boy into a free, financially literate, independent young warrior before the system eats him.
