# Chapter 3: The Bank’s Hidden Feast  
**How Loans, Cards, and Deposits Quietly Make Banks Richer**

You think you’re just going about your day swiping your card, making a loan payment, maybe depositing a check.  

But the banks? They’re feasting.  

With every transaction you make, with every loan you take, with every check you deposit, the banks grow richer. And here's the thing: you’re often completely unaware of how you’re funding this system.  

The entire banking structure is built on one simple principle: **leverage**. Banks don’t just make money from your deposits or loans. They **leverage** both to multiply their profits — and they do it at your expense.  

It’s time to break down this hidden feast and show you exactly how it’s happening behind your back.

## 1. Loans: Creating Wealth from Thin Air

Let’s start with loans — the bread and butter of the banking system.  

When you go to the bank and take out a loan, you probably think they’re doing you a favor. After all, you’re paying interest, so they must be taking a risk, right?  

**Wrong.**  

Banks aren’t risking anything. In fact, they’re **creating money out of thin air** every time they issue a loan.  

They don’t give you cash from a vault. They credit your account digitally — pulling it from nothing. The moment they do that, **you’re in debt, and they’re in profit**.  

> The bank doesn’t own the money they lend you, but they still charge you interest on it.

That interest you pay doesn’t come from anything real either. It’s just more digital money added to your debt.  

It’s the perfect scam:  
- You take a loan  
- The bank earns interest  
- The original money was never real to begin with

## 2. Credit Cards: The Gift That Keeps on Taking

You swipe, you buy, you owe — simple, right?  

But the system is designed to make you **pay, and pay, and pay**.  

When you use a credit card:  
- You're borrowing digital money  
- You owe the bank, with interest  
- And the real profit? **Interest rates**  

Credit card interest often ranges from **15% to 30%** — not to cover risk, but to maximize profits.  

> The more you owe, the more they make.  

And then come the **fees**:  
- Late payment fees  
- Over-limit fees  
- Annual fees  

It’s not a system to help you build wealth. It’s a **trap to keep the bank rich** while you fall deeper into debt.

## 3. Deposits: Turning Your Savings into Their Profit

You deposit money into a bank and think, *"It’s safe."*  

But the truth?  
- The bank **uses your deposit** to make more money  
- Keeps a small fraction (e.g., 10%)  
- Lends the rest to others — at interest  

You get:  
- Minimal interest (if any)  
- A false sense of security  

> They’re using your money to get rich, while giving you pennies in return.

Welcome to the **fractional reserve system**.

## 4. The Real Profit Comes From Fees and Penalties

Banks love fees.  
And they make billions off them.  

Whether it’s:  
- Overdraft fees  
- Bounced check fees  
- Late payment fees  

They depend on your **mistakes** to pad their bottom line.  

The worst part?  
Banks **design systems to make you slip up**:
- Hard-to-track payments  
- Confusing policies  
- Traps in fine print  

It’s not accidental. It’s engineered.

## 5. The Endgame: The Bank Gets Paid, No Matter What

Here’s the brutal reality:  
**The bank always wins.**

- Loan? They earn interest  
- Credit card? They earn more interest + fees  
- Deposit? They lend it and profit again  
- Even if you pay early — they profit from the **spread**

> The system is rigged to ensure they win, and you hustle just to stay afloat.

## So, What’s the Solution?

The banks have constructed an elaborate web designed to **trap you**.  

But you can **break free**.

### The key is awareness.

Once you understand how banks profit off you, you can:
- Stop depending on them  
- Build your own financial path  
- **Reclaim control** over your money

Now that you’ve seen how banks quietly profit from everything you do — borrowing, spending, saving — the question is:

**What are you going to do with this knowledge?**

How will you break free from a system that’s designed to keep you dependent?

**Up next:** We’ll explore how the banks themselves are working behind the scenes to get richer by creating debt — and how you can play the game without getting played.
